# Best GitHub Backup

[![test](https://github.com/ctcpip/best-github-backup/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ctcpip/best-github-backup/actions/workflows/test.yml)

this is the best GitHub backup program. it does not suck, and here is why:

- robust and resilient implementation
  - network failed in the middle of the operation? computer went to sleep? no problem. it will pick up where it left off when you run it again
    - no more worrying about having to start the entire process over again ðŸ™Š
- flat file database
  - all records are MessagePack files
  - if you're feeling adventurous you can `JSON.stringify()` the entire database ðŸ™ˆ
    - go on. do it.
- efficient use of the GitHub API
  - makes as few requests as possible
  - only fetches new data since the last successful run
    - it won't miss anything if there was a failure at any point. checkpoints get updated on a per-repo, per-type basis and only after all records were successfully saved
  - only fetches the important stuff
    - if it's not included, you don't need it. probably. ðŸ™‰

## Install

```sh
npm i -g best-github-backup
```

## Use

you'll need a [GitHub API token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) with at least `repo` and `read:org` scopes ðŸ”­

BEST-GITHUB-BACKUP(1)       General Commands Manual       BEST-GITHUB-BACKUP(1)

NAME
     best-github-backup - the best GitHub backup program (trust me bro)

SYNOPSIS
     best-github-backup -t token -o organization [-afgv] [-d daysThreshold]
                        [-e repo1,repo2,...]
     best-github-backup --help
     best-github-backup --version
     (See the OPTIONS section for alternate option syntax with long option
     names.)

DESCRIPTION
     Takes a backup for a given GitHub organization of all repositories that
     the provided token can access.
     It will run in one of two modes:
       1. Backup mode (default), where information is pulled from GitHub, or
       2. Archive mode (option -a), where compressed files are created for
       backups that have been taken already with backup mode.

OPTIONS
     -a, --archive
            Create compressed files for archiving.

     -d daysThreshold, --days daysThreshold
            Skip backup for repos that have been successfully backed up within
            the last daysThreshold days.

     -e repo1,repo2,..., --exclude repo1,repo2,...
            Exclude specified repos from backup.

            Note: this option is ignored in archive mode (option -a).
            Archive mode will process whatever exists from the previously taken
            backup(s). If you want to exclude anything from the archive, it
            must have been excluded from all backups. If you are uncertain, you
            should delete the data folder (data/orgName) and take a new backup
            with the exclude option.

     -f, --force
            Force update GitHub content. (By default, we only query for new
            content since the last successful backup was taken.)

     -g, --git
            Clone (or update existing clone of) git repos.

     -h, --help
            ðŸ†˜ HELP!

     -o org, --org org
            GitHub organization to backup.

     -t token, --token token
            GitHub token to use for authentication.

     -v, --verbose
            Verbose logging.

     --version
            Show version.

EXAMPLES
     best-github-backup -t token -o organization
            Backup an organization.

     best-github-backup -t token -o organization -a
            Create compressed files for archiving.

     best-github-backup -t token -o organization -g
            Backup an organization, including git repositories.

     best-github-backup -t token -o organization -ag
            Create compressed files for archiving, including git repositories.

     best-github-backup -t token -o organization -g -e repo1,repo2,...
            Backup an organization, including git repositories, but excluding
            some repositories.
